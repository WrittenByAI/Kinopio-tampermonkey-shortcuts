Additional shortcuts for Kinopio

Hey everyone

I've created a browser script that adds some extra keyboard shortcuts to Kinopio (not working for desktop app).

Checkbox (Toggle): Alt + Q  
Connection Type: Alt + W  
Tags: Alt + E  
Color: Alt + R  
H1 (Header 1): Alt + A  
H2 (Header 2): Alt + S  
Sidebar: Alt + D  
Frame -> Garden Leaves: Alt + Z  
Image: Alt + X  
Copy Card Names: Alt + C (original ctrl+c is buggy for me)  
Merge: Alt + V  
Split Card: Alt + G  
Spaces: Alt + `  

To get them working, you'll need to:

1.Download the Tampermonkey browser extension.   
2. Create a new script in Tampermonkey and paste in this code.  
3. Restart browser

Everything is working for me in Edge on Windows. It might not work for everyone, as the shortcuts could potentially conflict if they are already assigned to other functions on your system or in your browser.
